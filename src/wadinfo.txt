Description             : A (fully vanilla Doom-compatible) Heretic + Hexen
crossover project, putting lots of weapons and monsters from those games
(and some customs) into Doom. Some creative liberties were taken due to
limitations. Fully compatible with Doom 1 as well! Making use of Fraggle's
limited palette hack means the mod is compatible with Back to Saturn X and
Sunlust. Technically D2TWID as well, but it's secret maps will break due to
the dehackery in place here. You play as Baratus, the fighter class from Hexen.
This time he's a little more willing to use ranged weapons and more
magic, though! And he'll need it because a lot of the enemies are especially
nasty here.
